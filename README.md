Experiment No.- 01 
Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a bash table implementation to
quickly look up client's telephone number. Make use of two collision handling techniques and
compare them. using number of comparisons required to find a set of telephone numbers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Experiment No.- 02
Implement all the functions of a dictionary (ADT) using hashing and handle collisions using
chaining with/without replacement. Data: Set of (key, value) pairs, Keys are mapped to values,
Keys must be comparable, Keys must be unique. Standard Operations: Insert (key, value), Find
(key), Delete(key).

Experiment No.- 03
A book consists of chapters, chapters consist of sections and sections consist of subsections.
Construct a tree and print the nodes. Find the time and space requirements of your method.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Experiment No.- 04
Beginning with an empty binary search tree, Construct binary search tree by inserting the
values in the order given. After constructing a binary tree - i. Insert new node, ii. Find number
of nodes in longest path from root, iii. Minimum data value found in the tree, iv. Change a tree
so that the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped at every node, v. Search a value.

Experiment No.- 05
A Dictionary stores keywords and its meanings. Provide facility for adding new keywords,
deleting keywords, updating values of any entry. Provide facility to display whole data sorted in
ascending/ Descending order. Also find how many maximum comparisons may require for
finding any keyword. Use Binary Search Tree for implementation.

Experiment No.- 06
There are flight paths between cities. If there is a flight between city A and city B then there is
an t edge between the cities. The cost of the edge can be the time that flight. takes to reach city B
from A or the amount of fuel used for the journey. Represent this as a graph. The node can be
represented by airport name or name of the city. Use adjacency list representation of the graph
or use adjacency matrix representation of the graph. Check whether the graph is connected or
not. Justify the storage representation used.

Experiment No.- 07
A Dictionary stores keywords & it meanings. Provide facility for adding new keywords, deleting
keywords, updating values of any. entry. Provide facility to display whole data sorted in
ascending/Descending order. Also find how many maximum comparisons may require for
finding any keyword. Use Height balance tree and find the complexity for finding a keyword.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Experiment No.- 08
Read the marks obtained by students of second year in an online examination of particular
subject. Find out maximum and minimum marks obtained in that subject. Use heap data
structure. Analyze the algorithm.
